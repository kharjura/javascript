<!--Asynchronous programming in js
1)Asynchronous programming allows us to handle tasks that date time
  ex: Fectching data from an external source
2)Execution happens without blocking the execution of that time taken code
3)js is single threaded meaning it can process only one operation at a time,with asynchronous
programe we can perform non locking tasks to keep the application responsive
  eg:a)order pizza
  b) call Friend
  CORE CONCEPTS OF ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING:
  1)callbacks:
    a)callbacks are functions passed as arguements to other functions, once Asynchronous execution is 
      complete the callbacks will be executer
    b)callbacks can become complex an become hard to manage leading to callback hell
   2)Promise:
   a)promise represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation
   b)these make it easier to handle callback hell
   3)Async/Await:
   a)It is built on promises, makes the syntax look simple
   b)It makes an asynchronous code look aynchronous   -->
   callback function:
   *function which are past on as parameter to another function is called as callback function
   *the function which accept the callback function is called as higher order function(HOF)
   Nested callback:
   *callback which are Nested one within the other leads to Nested Callbacks
   *depely Nested callbacks lead to callbackhell
   *callback hell is a phenomenon where multiple callbacks are depely Nested & read ability &
     understand ability of code decreases trastically
     * It leads to parameter like structure known as peramid of dom
     syntax:
            function(() => <
            () => <
            () => <
            () => <
            > }}});
    Advantages of callbacks:
    *It can be used to handle Asynchronous Function where the result of 1. function is depended on another
    Disadvantages:
    *It leads to multiple callback to hell.
