Promises in javaScript:
1)promises are object that represent the eventual complition or failure of an Asynchronous
operation and it's resulting value.
2)They help in handling Asynchronous code more cleanly lay avoiding callback hell.
It makes the code look more readable and organized
-->
<!--Key Concept in Promise:
1)State of the Promise:
     A promise object has three states
a) pending:
     It is the enitial state where the promise hasn't been fullfilled or rejected yet
b) fullfilled:
    The asynchronous operation is completed Successfully and a value is returned
c) Rejected:
     The operation has failed to return a value and an error is thrown
2) Promise Creation:
      promise is created using promise constructor which takes of a function parameter.
      The function takes two parameters resolve & reject which controls the fullfillment
      or rejection & of the promise
3) using Then,Catch&finally
     *  when the promise is fullfill the Then function is called which takes the resolved value.
     *when the promise is rejected catch function(block) is called which handles errors
        finally block is called regardless of the promise fullfill or not
4) promise chain is possible making it easier to handle multiple asynchronous operation-->
<!-- Benefits of promises:
 a) makes asynchronous code easier to read
 b) errors are handled in a more readable manner
 c) makes asynchronous flows more managable using promise chain
 d) promises form basis of Async/await.-->
