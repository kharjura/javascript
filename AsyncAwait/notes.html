<!--
Async/Await:
1)It provides a clean & easy to read way to work with asynchrnous program that deal with promises
2)They make asynchronous code behave more like synchronous code and also reduce they need of Then and catch
Async:
1)An Async Function returns a promise Automatically even if it appears to be hear non-promise code.
   *An Async function is defined using Async keyword.
2)Inside the Async Function we used await to pause the execution until the promise resolved
Await:
1)These keyword always used in Async functions to wait for promise to be resolved before 
the executing the next line
2)If promise is rejected an error is thrown which can be handled using try & catch.
syntax:
async function getData() {
        try{
        conet data = await fetchData();
        c.log(data);
        }catch(error){
        c.log(error)
        }
        }-->
